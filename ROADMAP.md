# rkt roadmap

**work in progress**

This document defines a high level roadmap for rkt development.
The dates below should not be considered authoritative, but rather indicative of the projected timeline of the project.
The [milestones defined in GitHub](https://github.com/coreos/rkt/milestones) represent the most up-to-date state of affairs.

rkt is an implementation of the [App Container spec](https://github.com/appc/spec), which is still under active development on an approximately similar timeframe.
Until the specification reaches version 1.0, rkt's major/minor versions will trail that of the spec.
