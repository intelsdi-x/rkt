Work in progress. Please contribute if you see an area that needs more detail.

## Downloading Images (ACIs)

[aci-images]: https://github.com/appc/spec/blob/master/spec/aci.md#app-container-image
[appc-discovery]: https://github.com/appc/spec/blob/master/spec/discovery.md#app-container-image-discovery

rkt runs applications packaged as [Application Container Images (ACI)][aci-images] an open-source specification. ACIs consist of the root filesystem of the application container, a manifest and an optional signature.

ACIs are named with a URL-like structure. This naming scheme allows for a decentralized discovery of ACIs, related signatures and public keys. rkt uses these hints to execute [meta discovery][appc-discovery].

### rkt trust

Before executing a remotely fetched ACI, rkt will verify it based on attached signatures generated by the ACI creator.

Before this can happen, rkt needs to know which creators you trust, and therefore are trusted to run images on your machine. The identity of each ACI creator is established with a public key, which is placed in rkt's key store on disk.

When adding a trusted key, a prefix can scope the level of established trust to a subset of images. A few examples:

```
# rkt trust --prefix=storage.coreos.com
```

```
# rkt trust --prefix=coreos.com/etcd
```

To trust a key for an entire root domain, you must use the `--root` flag, with a path to a local key file (no discovery). 

```
# rkt trust --root ~/aci-pubkeys.gpg
```

#### Trust a Key Using Meta Discovery

The easiest way to trust a key is through meta discovery. rkt will find and download a public key that the creator has published on their website. This process is detailed in the [Application Container specification][appc-discovery]. The TL;DR is rkt will find a meta tag that looks like:

```
<meta name="ac-discovery-pubkeys" content="coreos.com/etcd https://coreos.com/dist/pubkeys/aci-pubkeys.gpg">
```

And use it to download the public key and present it to you for approval:

```
# rkt trust --prefix=coreos.com/etcd
Prefix: "coreos.com/etcd"
Key: "https://coreos.com/dist/pubkeys/aci-pubkeys.gpg"
GPG key fingerprint is: 8B86 DE38 890D DB72 9186  7B02 5210 BD88 8818 2190
  CoreOS ACI Builder <release@coreos.com>
Are you sure you want to trust this key (yes/no)? yes
Trusting "https://coreos.com/dist/pubkeys/aci-pubkeys.gpg" for prefix "coreos.com/etcd".
Added key for prefix "coreos.com/etcd" at "/etc/rkt/trustedkeys/prefix.d/coreos.com/etcd/8b86de38890ddb7291867b025210bd8888182190"
```

If rkt can't find a key using meta discovery, an error will be printed:

```
# rkt trust --prefix=coreos.com
Error determining key location: --prefix meta discovery error: found no ACI meta tags
```

#### Trust a Key From Specific Location

If you know where a public key is located, you can request it directly from disk or via HTTPS:

```
# rkt trust --prefix=coreos.com/etcd https://coreos.com/dist/pubkeys/aci-pubkeys.gpg
Prefix: "coreos.com/etcd"
Key: "https://coreos.com/dist/pubkeys/aci-pubkeys.gpg"
GPG key fingerprint is: 8B86 DE38 890D DB72 9186  7B02 5210 BD88 8818 2190
  CoreOS ACI Builder <release@coreos.com>
Are you sure you want to trust this key (yes/no)? yes
Trusting "https://coreos.com/dist/pubkeys/aci-pubkeys.gpg" for prefix "coreos.com/etcd".
Added key for prefix "coreos.com/etcd" at "/etc/rkt/trustedkeys/prefix.d/coreos.com/etcd/8b86de38890ddb7291867b025210bd8888182190"
```

#### Pre-Populating Trusted Keys on Disk

Trusted public keys can be pre-populated by placing them in the appropriate location on disk for the desired prefix.

```
$ ls -l /etc/rkt/trustedkeys/
[insert example of root key vs prefixed key]
```

### rkt fetch

rkt uses HTTPS to locate and download remote ACIs and their attached signatures. If the ACI exists locally, it won't be re-downloaded.

#### Fetch with Meta Discovery

The easiest way to fetch an ACI is through meta discovery. rkt will find and download the ACI and signature from a location that the creator has published on their website. This process is detailed in the [Application Container specification][appc-discovery].

If you have previously trusted the image creator, it will be downloaded and verified:

```
# rkt fetch coreos.com/etcd:v2.0.0
rkt: searching for app image coreos.com/etcd:v2.0.0
rkt: fetching image from https://github.com/coreos/etcd/releases/download/v2.0.0/etcd-v2.0.0-linux-amd64.aci
Downloading aci: [=======================================      ] 3.25 MB/3.7 MB
Downloading signature from https://github.com/coreos/etcd/releases/download/v2.0.0/etcd-v2.0.0-linux-amd64.sig
rkt: signature verified:
  CoreOS ACI Builder <release@coreos.com>
sha512-fa1cb92dc276b0f9bedf87981e61ecde
```

If you haven't trusted the creator, it will be downloaded but not verified:

```
# rkt fetch coreos.com/etcd:v2.0.0
rkt: searching for app image coreos.com/etcd:v2.0.0
rkt: fetching image from https://github.com/coreos/etcd/releases/download/v2.0.0/etcd-v2.0.0-linux-amd64.aci
Downloading aci: [=======================================      ] 3.25 MB/3.7 MB
Downloading signature from https://github.com/coreos/etcd/releases/download/v2.0.0/etcd-v2.0.0-linux-amd64.sig
rkt: fetching image from https://github.com/coreos/etcd/releases/download/v2.0.0/etcd-v2.0.0-linux-amd64.aci
sha512-fa1cb92dc276b0f9bedf87981e61ecde
```

#### Fetch from Specific Location

If you already know where an image is stored, you can fetch it directly:

```
# rkt fetch https://github.com/coreos/etcd/releases/download/v2.0.0/etcd-v2.0.0-linux-amd64.aci
rkt: fetching image from https://github.com/coreos/etcd/releases/download/v2.0.0/etcd-v2.0.0-linux-amd64.aci
Downloading aci: [=======================================      ] 3.25 MB/3.7 MB
Downloading signature from https://github.com/coreos/etcd/releases/download/v2.0.0/etcd-v2.0.0-linux-amd64.sig
rkt: fetching image from https://github.com/coreos/etcd/releases/download/v2.0.0/etcd-v2.0.0-linux-amd64.aci
sha512-fa1cb92dc276b0f9bedf87981e61ecde
```

#### Fetch from a Docker registry

If you want to run an existing Docker image, you can fetch from a Docker registry. rkt will download and convert the image to ACI.

```
# rkt --insecure-skip-verify fetch docker://busybox
rkt: fetching image from docker://busybox
rkt: warning: signature verification has been disabled
Downloading layer: 4986bf8c15363d1c5d15512d5266f8777bfba4974ac56e3270e7760f6f0a8125

sha512-c4010045aec65aefa74770ef2bb648d9
```

Docker images do not support signature verification.

#### Authentication

If you want to download an image from a private repository, then you will often need to pass credentials to be able to access it. rkt currently supports authentication for fetching images via https:// or docker:// protocols. To specify credentials you will have to write some configuration files. You can find the format of the configuration file and examples in the [configuration documentation](configuration.md). Note that the configuration kind for images downloaded via https:// and images downloaded via docker:// is different.

## Running Pods

rkt can run ACIs based on name, hash, local file on disk or URL. If an ACI hasn't been cached on disk, rkt will attempt to find and download it.
Prior to running pods, ensure that the [metadata service](https://github.com/coreos/rkt/blob/master/Documentation/metadata-service.md) is running.

### rkt run

#### Image Addressing

Images can be run by either their name, their hash, an explicit transport address, or a Docker registry URL.

```
# Run by name
# rkt run coreos.com/etcd:v2.0.0
```

```
# Run by hash
# rkt run sha512-fa1cb92dc276b0f9bedf87981e61ecde
```

```
# Run by ACI address
# rkt run https://github.com/coreos/etcd/releases/download/v2.0.0/etcd-v2.0.0-linux-amd64.aci
```

```
# Run by Docker registry
# rkt run docker://quay.io/coreos/etcd:v2.0.0
```

#### Passing Arguments

To pass additional arguments to images use the pattern of `image1 -- [image1 flags] --- image2 -- [image2 flags]`.
For example:

```
# rkt run example.com/worker -- --loglevel verbose --- example.com/syncer -- --interval 30s
```

#### Influencing Environment Variables

To inherit all environment variables from the parent use the `--inherit-env` flag.

To explicitly set individual environment variables use the `--set-env` flag.

The precedence is as follows with the last item replacing previous environment entries:

- Parent environment
- App image environment
- Explicitly set environment

```
# export EXAMPLE_ENV=hello
# export EXAMPLE_OVERRIDE=under
# rkt run --inherit-env --set-env=FOO=bar --set-env=EXAMPLE_OVERRIDE=over example.com/env-printer
EXAMPLE_ENV=hello
FOO=bar
EXAMPLE_OVERRIDE=over
```

#### Disable Signature Verification

If desired, `--insecure-skip-verify` can be used to disable this security check:

```
# rkt --insecure-skip-verify run coreos.com/etcd:v2.0.0
rkt: searching for app image coreos.com/etcd:v2.0.0
rkt: fetching image from https://github.com/coreos/etcd/releases/download/v2.0.0/etcd-v2.0.0-linux-amd64.aci
rkt: warning: signature verification has been disabled
...
```

#### Mount Volumes into a Pod

Volumes are defined in each ACI and are referenced by name. Volumes can be exposed from the host into the pod (`host`) or initialized as empty storage to be accessed locally within the pod (`empty` pending [rkt #378][rkt #378]). Each volume can be selectively mounted into each application at differing mount points or not mounted into specific apps at all.

[rkt #378]: https://github.com/coreos/rkt/issues/378


##### Mounting Host Volumes

For `host` volumes, the `--volume` flag allows you to specify each mount, its type and the location on the host. The volume is then mounted into each app running to the pod based on information defined in the ACI manifest.

For example, let's say we want to read data from the host directory `/opt/tenant1/work` to power a MapReduce-style worker. We'll call this app `example.com/reduce-worker`.

We also want this data to be available to a backup application that runs alongside the worker (in the same pod). We'll call this app 'example.com/worker-backup`. The backup application only needs read-only access to the data.

Below we show the abbreviated manifests for the respective applications (recall that the manifest is bundled into the application's ACI):

```
{
    "acKind": "ImageManifest",
    "name": "example.com/reduce-worker",
    ...
    "app": {
        ...
        "mountPoints": [
            {
                "name": "work",
                "path": "/var/lib/work",
                "readOnly": false
            }
        ],
    ...
}
```

```
{
    "acKind": "ImageManifest",
    "name": "example.com/worker-backup",
    ...
    "app": {
        ...
        "mountPoints": [
            {
                "name": "work",
                "path": "/backup",
                "readOnly": true
            }
        ],
    ...
}
```

In this case, both apps reference a volume they call "work", and expect it to be made available at `/var/lib/work` and `/backup` within their respective root filesystems. 

Since they reference the volume using an abstract name rather than a specific source path, the same image can be used on a variety of different hosts without being coupled to the host's filesystem layout.

To tie it all together, we use the `rkt run` command-line to provide them with a volume by this name. Here's what it looks like:

```
# rkt run --volume=work,kind=host,source=/opt/tenant1/work \
  example.com/reduce-worker \
  example.com/worker-backup
```

Now when the pod is running, the two apps will see the host's `/opt/tenant1/work` directory made available at their expected locations.

#### Disabling metadata service registration

By default, `rkt run` will register the pod with the [metadata service](https://github.com/coreos/rkt/blob/master/Documentation/metadata-service.md).
If the metadata service is not running, it is possible to disable this behavior with `--register-mds=false` command line option.

#### Customize Networking

The default networking configuration for rkt is "host networking".
This means that the apps within the pod will share the network stack and the interfaces with the host machine.

##### Private Networking

Another common configuration, "private networking", means the pod will be executed with its own network stack.
This is similar to how other container tools work.

By default, rkt private networking will create a loopback device and a veth device.
The veth pair creates a point-to-point link between the pod and the host.
rkt will allocate an IPv4 /31 (2 IP addresses) out of 172.16.28.0/24 and assign one IP to each end of the veth pair.
It will additionally set a default route in the pod namespace.
Finally, it will enable IP masquerading on the host to NAT the egress traffic.

```
# rkt run --private-net coreos.com/etcd:v2.0.0
```

##### Other Networking Examples

Additional networking modes and more examples can be found in the [networking documentation](https://github.com/coreos/rkt/blob/master/Documentation/networking.md)

### rkt enter

Given a pod UUID, if you want to enter a running pod to explore its filesystem or see what's running you can use rkt enter.

```
# rkt enter 76dc6286
Pod contains multiple apps:
        redis
        etcd
Unable to determine app name: specify app using "rkt enter --app= ..."

# rkt enter --app=redis 76dc6286
No command specified, assuming "/bin/bash"
root@rkt-76dc6286-f672-45f2-908c-c36dcd663560:/# ls
bin   data  entrypoint.sh  home  lib64  mnt  proc  run   selinux  sys  usr
boot  dev   etc            lib   media  opt  root  sbin  srv      tmp  var
```

#### Use a Custom Stage 1

rkt is designed and intended to be modular, using a [staged architecture](devel/architecture.md).

You can use a custom stage1 by using the `--stage1-image` flag.

```
# rkt --stage1-image=/tmp/stage1.aci run coreos.com/etcd:v2.0.0
```

For more details see the [hacking documentation](hacking.md).

#### Run a Pod in the Background

Work in progress. Please contribute!

## Pod inspection

### rkt list

You can list all rkt pods.


```
# rkt list
UUID		APP	    ACI 		    STATE	NETWORKS
5bc080ca	redis	redis		    running	default:ip4=172.16.28.7
        	etcd	coreos.com/etcd
3089337c	nginx	nginx		    exited
```

### rkt status

Given a pod UUID, you can get the exit status of its apps.

```
# rkt status 5bc080ca
state=exited
pid=-1
exited=true
etcd=0
redis=0
```

If the pod is still running, you can wait for it to finish and then get the status with `rkt status --wait UUID`

## Metadata Service

Work in progress. Please contribute!

### rkt metadata-service

Work in progress. Please contribute!

### Logging

By default, rkt will send logs directly to stdout/stderr, allowing them to be caputered by the invoking process.
On host systems running systemd, rkt will attempt to integrate with journald on the host.
In this case, the logs can be accessed directly via journalctl.

#### Accessing logs via journalctl

To get the logs of a running pod you need to get pod's machine name. You can use machinectl

```
$ machinectl
MACHINE                                  CLASS     SERVICE
rkt-f241c969-1710-445a-8129-d3a7ffdd9a60 container nspawn

1 machines listed.
```

or `rkt list --full`

```
# rkt list --full
UUID					                APP	    ACI 	STATE	NETWORKS
f241c969-1710-445a-8129-d3a7ffdd9a60	busybox	busybox	running
```

Pod's machine name will be the pod's UUID with a `rkt-` prefix.

Then you can use systemd's journalctl:

```
# journalctl -M rkt-f241c969-1710-445a-8129-d3a7ffdd9a60

[...]
```

## Interacting with the local image store

### rkt image list

You can get a list of images in the local store with their keys, app names and import times.

```
# rkt image list
KEY                                                                     APPNAME                         IMPORTTIME                              LATEST
sha512-fa1cb92dc276b0f9bedf87981e61ecde93cc16432d2441f23aa006a42bb873df coreos.com/etcd:v2.0.0          2015-07-10 10:14:37.323 +0200 CEST      false
sha512-a03f6bad952b30ca1875b1b179ab34a0f556cfbf3893950f59c408992d1bc891 coreos.com/rkt/stage1:0.7.0     2015-07-12 20:27:56.041 +0200 CEST      false
```

### rkt image rm

Given an image key you can remove it from the local store.

```
# rkt image rm sha512-a03f6bad952b30ca1875b1b179ab34a0f556cfbf3893950f59c408992d1bc891
rkt: successfully removed aci for imageID: "sha512-a03f6bad952b30ca1875b1b179ab34a0f556cfbf3893950f59c408992d1bc891"
rkt: 1 image(s) successfully remove
```

### rkt image export

There are cases where you might want to export the ACI from the store to copy to another machine, file server, etc.

```
# rkt image export coreos.com/etcd etcd.aci
$ tar xvf etcd.aci
```

NOTES:
- A matching image must be fetched before doing this operation, rkt will not attempt to download an image first, this subcommand will incur no-network I/O.
- The exported ACI file might be different than the original one because rkt image export always returns uncompressed ACIs.


### rkt image extract/render

For debugging or inspection you may want to extract an ACI to a directory on disk. There are a few different options depending on your use case but the basic command looks like this:

```
# rkt image extract coreos.com/etcd etcd-extracted
# find etcd-extracted
etcd-extracted
etcd-extracted/manifest
etcd-extracted/rootfs
etcd-extracted/rootfs/etcd
etcd-extracted/rootfs/etcdctl
...
```

NOTE: Like with rkt image export, a matching image must be fetched before doing this operation.

Now there are some flags that can be added to this:

To get just the rootfs use:

```
# rkt image extract --rootfs-only coreos.com/etcd etcd-extracted
# find etcd-extracted
etcd-extracted
etcd-extracted/etcd
etcd-extracted/etcdctl
...
```

If you want the image rendered as it would look ready-to-run inside of the rkt stage2 then use `rkt image render`. NOTE: this will not use overlayfs or any other mechanism. This is to simplify the cleanup: to remove the extracted files you can run a a simple `rm -Rf`.

### rkt image cat-manifest

For debugging or inspection you may want to extract an ACI manifest to stdout.

```
# rkt image cat-manifest --pretty-print coreos.com/etcd
{
  "acVersion": "0.6.1",
  "acKind": "ImageManifest",
...
```

## Other Commands

### rkt gc

rkt has a built-in garbage collection command that is designed to be run periodically from a timer or cron job. Stopped pods are moved to the garbage and cleaned up during a subsequent garbage collection pass. Each `gc` pass removes any pods remaining in the garbage past the grace period. [Read more about the pod lifecycle][gc-docs].

[gc-docs]: https://github.com/coreos/rkt/blob/master/Documentation/devel/pod-lifecycle.md#garbage-collection

```
# rkt gc --grace-period=30m0s
Moving pod "21b1cb32-c156-4d26-82ae-eda1ab60f595" to garbage
Moving pod "5dd42e9c-7413-49a9-9113-c2a8327d08ab" to garbage
Moving pod "f07a4070-79a9-4db0-ae65-a090c9c393a3" to garbage
```

On the next pass, the pods are removed:

```
# rkt gc --grace-period=30m0s
Garbage collecting pod "21b1cb32-c156-4d26-82ae-eda1ab60f595"
Garbage collecting pod "5dd42e9c-7413-49a9-9113-c2a8327d08ab"
Garbage collecting pod "f07a4070-79a9-4db0-ae65-a090c9c393a3"
```
